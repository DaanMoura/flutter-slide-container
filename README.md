# Slide Container

A container that can be slid vertically and horizontally with a smooth dampened motion.

Offers a handful of callbacks for customization and handles both drag distance and velocity to validate swipe gestures.

Features a customized GestureDetector to reduce nested GestureDetector conflicts.

Build the `example` folder with `flutter run` for a demo, or check the video in this blog post:
